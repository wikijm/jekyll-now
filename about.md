Hello visitor,

My name is Jean-Marc and I've worked in Cyber Security since 2017 for companies in different domains, and before doing System Technical Assistance, Administration and Infrastructure definition since 2009.

The majority of my time working in Cyber Security has been within a Security Operations Center as a CSOC Analyst. This has also included Threat Hunting and Investigations, with a focus on Active Directory and Microsoft systems.

I love what I do and think there is real value in sharing knowledge amongst the Cyber Industry.
This is why I decided to setup this site.

Feel free to contact me thanks to the links visibile in the footer.

Regards,
Jean-Marc ALBERT, aka WikiJM
